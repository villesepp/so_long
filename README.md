# so_long

![game](./screenshots/logosolong.jpg)

A small game project inspired by Wolfenstein 3D (developed and released by id Software in 1992). Made at Hive Helsinki with the use of very feature-limited Minilibx to render things in a window. For Linux only.

## Graphics

Graphics were made using Blender and Photoshop by me. Included are:
- 4 directions for the player to face
- 4 kinds of wall tiles to add some variety
- 4 frames for key 'bling' animation
- 3 frames for sleeping guard animation
- 1 open exit, 1 closed exit
- 1 floor tile

**Yes, you may use or modify them for use in your own so_long project!**

Please give me credit if you do use them ðŸ˜„
